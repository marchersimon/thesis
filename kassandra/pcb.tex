\section{Component Selection}

Because almost none of the needed components where on hand in the school laboratories, most of them had to be ordered online. Due to the special requirements of some parts, they were rather hard to find and some compromises had to be made. For example, many of the needed components were only available as \acrshort{smd}s, which made prototyping a lot harder.

\subsection{\acrshort{ic}s}

When searching up the needed semiconductor parts, there was hardly any choice in terms of the packages. Therefore the board design changed to be smaller with less \acrshort{tht} parts.
