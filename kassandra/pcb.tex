\chapter{Printed Circuit Board}

\glspl{pcb} were an essential part of this project. At frequencies of a few MHz, breadboards can cause issues because of parasitic inductance and capacitance. Also, a lot of components were only available as \glspl{smd}, so prototyping on breadboards wouldn't have been possible anyways. For every prototype a new \gls{pcb} had to be etched, soldered and tested.

\section{Component Selection}

Because almost none of the needed components where on hand in the school laboratories, they had to be ordered online\sidenote{The component reseller of choice was Digi-Key}. Due to the special requirements of some parts, like the MOSFET or the , they were rather hard to find and some compromises had to be made.
For example, many of the needed components were only available as \glspl{smd}, which made prototyping a lot harder. 

\subsection{ICs}

When searching up the needed semiconductor parts, there was hardly any choice in terms of the packages. Therefore the board design changed to be smaller with less \gls{tht} parts.

\subsection{Passive Elements}



\subsection{Connectors}
