\section{Programming Environment}

In order to have the maximum amount of flexibility for configuring the hardware, the programming language C++ was chosen over the Arduino Language\sidenotes{Especially because some Arduino libraries tend to break, once the hardware it relies on has been configured manually.}. Instead of creating a Makefile for compiling and uploading to the board, the open source tool PlatformIO was used, which offers not just one-click compiling and uploading, but also automatic port detection, an integrated serial monitor and much more. Additionally, the whole source code was version controlled by git.
